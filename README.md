# Welcome to WoGetApp!

## Introduction
Nowadays, a lot of people need a space to work, alone or with a team, should they be students, freelancers, building a startup, etc. To complete this, working at home, at a coffeeshop or in a crowded library isn't always the best option.
To be able to focus and provide results, people should have a quiet available space, furnished as they need and in their area.
Our idea was to create a platform providing multiple options of spaces to rent anywhere you want, for one day or more and even have the opportunity to get all the tools you need to accomplish your tasks in the best way.
Furthermore, we allow anybody that have a vacant space to put it for rent on our plateform and be contacted by people in need.
As students living far from the campus, we felt the lack of this kind of service: we could not find a proper private space to meet in and conveniently work together for a few hours, somewhere close to all of us with all the tools needed. And this is how WoGet was born.
WoGet is the abbreviation for Get Work.


## Type of customers in WoGet
WoGet aims to let “Workers” rent private workspace from “Nudgers”:
Workers are people who want to have their own working place to study/work/meet in a pleasant workspace with all the tools adapted for their needs such as boards, desks, projectors, Wi-Fi, air-conditioning, multiple wires, coffee and more. The Woget app puts the Workers in touch with Nudgers, people/businesses who have a spare and unused local/garage/basement/room/ or any kind of place –that we call a “Nudge” - they can furnish in accordance of working needs and want to rent it for a few hours/days.
Pros of libraries without the cons : no more wasting time looking for a place in crowded libraries, and you get your own personal space with all the convenience that comes with it.
